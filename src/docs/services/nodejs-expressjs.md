# Service: NodeJS with ExpressJS

- **Path:** [./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi/](https://github.com/ericis/hello-cloud/tree/main/src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi)
- **Runtime:** [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) ðŸ”—
- **Language:** [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) ðŸ”—
- **Framework:** [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) ðŸ”—

## Getting started

The [contributor guide](../contribute.md) has the steps necessary to run this project locally.

## Deployments

### Docker

The "hello-world/our-hello-nodejs-expressjs-webapi" docker image is simply the packaged and runnable version of the web service.

Using the standard developer `make` tasks, the service can be containerized and executed with `docker`, `docker-compose` or `podman`. The DevOps pipeline for Continuous Integration (CI) and Deployment (CD) uses the `make deploy` task to build and deploy the service using the default "dev_tool" `docker`. The GitHub Actions workflow "./.github/workflows/nodejs_expressjs_webapi.yml" authenticates to the GitHub Container Registry for this repository and pushes (publishes) [the "hello-world/our-hello-nodejs-expressjs-webapi" image](https://github.com/ericis/hello-cloud/pkgs/container/hello-world%2Four-hello-nodejs-expressjs-webapi).

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

#### Prerequisites

- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) _\*this project worked with free infrastructure at the time of its creation_
- [`eb` CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)

#### Steps to deploy

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. `cd ./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi`)
2. Run the command `make aws-init` to create the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment. This command may take a few minutes. The `eb` CLI will prompt you for access credentials. Create a new access key by visiting ["Your Security Credentials"](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials), expanding "Access keys" and creating a new key.
3. Install the application with the command `make aws-install`. This command may take several seconds.
4. Check the application logs with the command `make aws-logs`
5. Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command `make aws-uninstall`. This command may take several seconds.

### Microsoft Azure

#### Prerequisites

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) _\*this project worked with free infrastructure at the time of its creation_
- [`az` CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

#### Steps to deploy

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. `cd ./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi`)
2. Login to your Azure account with the CLI using the command `az login`
3. If you have more than one subscription, first [set the default subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial/tutorial-vscode-azure-cli-node/tutorial-vscode-azure-cli-node-03#set-your-default-subscription)
4. Run the command `make azure-init` to create the Azure Resource Group
5. Install the application with the command `make azure-install`
6. Check the application logs with the command `make azure-logs`
7. Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command `make azure-uninstall`

### Google Cloud

#### Prerequisites

- An [Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/free) _\*this project worked with free infrastructure at the time of its creation_
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart)
- Google Cloud [Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
- Enable [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build) with the command `gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com`

#### Steps to deploy

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. `cd ./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi`)
2. Login to your Google Cloud account with the CLI using the command `gcloud auth login`
3. Run the command `make gcloud-init gcloud_project_name_suffix=001` to create the Google Cloud project
4. Install the application with the command `make gcloud-install`
5. Check the application logs with the command `make gcloud-logs`
6. Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command `make gcloud-uninstall gcloud_project_name_suffix=001`

_\*Update the "gcloud_project_name_suffix" argument value for `gcloud-init` and `gcloud-uninstall` by incrementing the number to ensure a unique project name, or specify a custom unique name by using the argument "gcloud_project_unique_name" instead. By default, Google Cloud retains deleted projects for several days, so it is not possible to recreate the same project multiple times. A future [contribution to this project](../contribute.md) could simply restore a deleted project if it was recently deleted and use the same name._

### SalesForce Heroku

#### Prerequisites

- A [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) _\*this project worked with free infrastructure at the time of its creation_
- [`heroku` CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#uninstalling-the-heroku-cli)

#### Steps to deploy

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. `cd ./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi`)
2. Login to your Heroku account with the CLI using the command `heroku login`
3. Run the command `make heroku-init` to create and configure the cloud app including assigning the [community monorepo buildpack](https://github.com/lstoll/heroku-buildpack-monorepo#readme) as well as the [node.js buildpack](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs)
4. Install the application with the command `make heroku-install`
5. Check the application logs with the command `make heroku-logs`
6. Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command `make heroku-uninstall`

## Roadmap

Future updates will deploy this service to multiple clouds using various backend infrastructure options.
